# 📱 Mobile Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Market Insights 🚀
EDA Python Pandas Seaborn

📌 Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of mobile phones to extract business insights for mobile companies. The analysis covers pricing trends, feature comparisons, brand performance, and market segmentation—helping companies optimize their product offerings, pricing strategies, and marketing approaches.

🔍 Key Questions Answered:

How do mobile prices vary across brands and models?

What is the relationship between RAM, battery, and price?

Which brands dominate the premium vs. budget segments?

How have mobile prices evolved over the years?
